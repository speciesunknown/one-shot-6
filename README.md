# one-shot-6
A simple system for story based tabletop RPG oneshots

All you need is the [Player Handout](./Core%20Rules/player%20handout.pdf), some dice, and some tokens to represent Story Points.

I welcome the creation of non open source modules for the game, provided the core rules remain free

# Contribution Guide
If anybody wants to add an openly licenced module or translation, just send a pull request. Grammar and spelling for the core rules should be British English. Pip pip.

I am looking for proof readers, and for somebody in the know to convert from markdown to latek (or whatever it's called these days) so we can get a better laid out .pdf handout.
